# Beerboon Labelator

A quick and dirty label generator for [beerboon](http://beerboon.co). It generates A4 sheets with 6 labels per sheet.

- Step 1: select the style of beer
- Step 2: enter the ABV
- Step 3: hit print in your browser, make sure to print backgrounds

For this to look great you will need to have the necessary fonts installed on your computer (licenses..) :)

Written as an experiment with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) in a simple structure for easy customisation.
Just fork this repo, chuck in your own assets & change the CSS to make it your own.

Happy customising, let me know what you think!
