# Beerboon Labelator

A quick and dirty label generator for [beerboon](http://beerboon.co).

- Step 1: select the style of beer
- Step 2: enter the ABV
- Step 3: hit print in your browser, make sure to print backgrounds

You will need to have the necessary fonts installed on your computer for this to look nice :)

Written with (Vue.js)[https://vuejs.org] as an experiment in the basic way for easy customisation.
Just fork this repo, slack in your own assets & change the CSS and you can make this work for you.

Happy customising, let me know what you think!
